This is a simple technology demo using MIT or BSD liscnced technology. 

The demo combines the jsish webserver, the vue framework, and an AdminLTE javscript frontend template framework adapted for Vue and the components supported by jsish

To see the demo, run the demo_jsi_app.sh script.

The original intent of the demo is to adjust this into an application skeleton that builds fossil repositories that are deployable as single cross platform artifacts.

Any and all patches accepted.

Tim.
